        <p class="p1">A lot of fans would say the NBA was at its best during the 1980s. That was back when Earvin "Magic" Johnson's Lakers would battle Larry Bird's Boston Celtics for the title almost every year.

            Those were also the days when Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins would square off in the dunk contest and the Detroit "Bad Boy" Pistons were handcuffing opponents with suffocating defense. 
            
            Yeah, the '80s were great, but I personally believe that the NBA during the 1990s was just a little bit better.</p>

        <p class="p1"> During the '90s, we sadly watched legends retire such as Johnson, Bird, Isiah Thomas, and Wilkins. However, we saw the entrance of promising young stars like Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, and Allen Iverson.    

            Of course, you simply cannot mention the '90s without bringing up the name, Michael Jordan. MJ was simply "The Man" as he won four of his five MVP awards and more importantly, teamed with Scottie Pippen to lead the Chicago Bulls to six championships.
            
            And if Jordan hadn't retired twice in the decade, most people would agree that the Bulls would have won a couple of more titles.  </p>
